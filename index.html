    <p>
        Nearly everyone we know is obsessed with Seoul and South Korea. Some are into the cosmetics. Many are hooked on the music and television dramas. And almost everyone, including us, is in love with the food.

        South Korean technology and pop culture has exploded into the global mainstream in recent years. This “Korean Wave” has turned Seoul into one of the hottest destinations in Asia, bringing in over 17.5 million international tourists in 2019.

        Unfortunately, the travel slowdown has brought this tourism wave to a halt, but expect it to surge with a vengeance when borders open up.
